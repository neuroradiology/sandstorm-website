    <h2>3. Install apps</h2>

    <div class="section-content">
    <p>Once you've logged in, install some apps!</p>

    <p>Apps in Sandstorm run with a click. You won't need to edit server configuration files or provision databases. Sandstorm manages access control, so apps are private by default.</p>
